#### Code the following app  
#### ```  
#### creates kids’ stories with illustrations.  
####   
#### ```  
####   
#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make are in the following files:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` values.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create a new file that describes the logo image to be generated.  

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A colorful illustration of a child holding a book with animated characters emerging from the pages, set against a bright sky background with clouds and a rainbow. The child is smiling, wearing a backpack, and the book is open, showing a whimsical forest scene inside. The overall style is playful and vibrant, suitable for a kids’ story app.
